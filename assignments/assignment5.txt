What is a Config Driven UI ?
    A "config-driven UI" is a user interface that is built and configured using a declarative configuration file or data structure, rather than being hardcoded. The configuration file or data structure typically contains information about the structure of the UI, such as the layout of the elements, the properties and behaviors of each element, and any data sources or APIs that the UI interacts with.
    Using a config-driven UI approach, the UI can be easily modified and customized without requiring changes to the underlying codebase. This makes it easier to maintain, extend, and scale the UI, and also allows for more rapid development and iteration.

    react , json form , Angular Schematics , formik supports building config driven ui
