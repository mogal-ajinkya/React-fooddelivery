finding the path    
    
imp notes  ---> 
        don,t create functional component inside applayout 
        don`t write useState inside if-else  condition  or for loop ---> it make it inconsistent
        use useState in functional component not outside 

        images are generally store in cdn 


what's the difference between () => {} and () => () ?   
            () => {}       ----> block of statement executed and then return explicitly
            () => ()       ----> single expression is created and implicit return

            read more may be not correct 


routing --->
    -> install npm i react-router-dom
    -> explore other router
    -> import {createBrowserRouter} from
    

dynamic routing ---->

    const { param } = useParams();
    console.log("parma " + param );

    {
        path:"/:id",
        element:<RestaurantDetails/>
      }

      here if name of path must be same as const { id } = useParams

     ** OR***
    
     const { param } = useParams();
    console.log("parma " + param );

    {
        path:"/restaurant/:id",
        element:<RestaurantDetails/>
    }

   here it reaturn object which contain object
