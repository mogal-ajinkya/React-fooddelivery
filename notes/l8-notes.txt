2] loadspage --- > render something  ->> APi call  - -->  render page  or upadate ui
   
-->to go for 2 nd process we use useEffect() hook
-->useEffect call the call back function after every render if we dont want to call it after every rerender we pass empty dependency array 
---> if we want to rerender for changes in some useState variable we pass in that dependency array

====> dependency array [searchTxt]  =? once after intial render + everytime after rerender (my searchTxt changes)

===> CONDITIONAL RENDERING
