1.building our own hook 
            why need of hook -- reusability 
                                readibility
                                maintanable 
                                testable 
                                seperate the concurences 



2. useRestaurant
3. useOnline
4. fake offline --- cleaning cache -- 
                    clear event listeners when change page 
                    how to remove 
5 . hook for -acess to local storage 
            - 

6. we can not have one bundle of our code as it might get heavy to load 
        we chunk it , code spllitting
        dynamic bundling , lazy loading
        on demand loading 
        dynamic import 

        while importing --- const Instamart = lazy( ()=> import("./components/Instamart"))

        as it take time to fetch the require bundle it throw error as react try to render but bundle not received yet so 
        we use  <Suspense><Suspense/>
        {
        path: "Instamart",
        element: (
          <Suspense>
            <Instamart/>
          </Suspense>)
        ,
      }

      we can also add fallback ={ }
              can add shimmer
