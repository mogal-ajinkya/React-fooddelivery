is ES6 mandatory ?? NOT

their must be only one parent inside jsx
    invalid -> const jsx = <h1> this is first</h1><h1>this is second </h1>
    valid -> const jsx = <div><h1> this is first</h1><h1>this is second </h1><div/>

    but if we donot want to add this tag then react provide use with react.Fragment
    const jsx = <React.Fragment><h1> this is first</h1><h1>this is second </h1><React.Fragment/>
    or
    const jsx = <> <h1> this is first</h1><h1>this is second </h1> </>
